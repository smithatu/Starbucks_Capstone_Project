## Description
This Capstone Project is a requirement under Udacity DSND Program.
In this project, we are trying to "Measure Marketing Campaign Effectiveness" using a data that mimics the Starbucks Reward mobile App data.
The data set provided, entails simulated data that mimics customer behavior on Starbucks rewards mobile app.Â 
Customers using Starbucks mobile app receive random offers from Starbucks, the offer might range from merely an informational offer advertising about a drink, to an discount offer that a customer can avail on their spending's at Starbucks, or a BOGO (Buy One Get One) offer.
All these offers are time bound with a designated expiry. The customers are rewarded based on their cumulative spend activity during the period in which offer was active. The offers are sent to customers in no particular order, some customers might not receive any offer, while not all user receive the same offer.

#### Data sets

The data is contained in three files:

* portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
* profile.json - demographic data for each customer
* transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

Here is the schema and explanation of each variable in the files:

**portfolio.json**
* id (string) - offer id
* offer_type (string) - type of offer ie BOGO, discount, informational
* difficulty (int) - minimum required spend to complete an offer

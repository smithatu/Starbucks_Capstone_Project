In this project, we are trying to "Measure Marketing Campaign Effectiveness" using a data that mimics the Starbucks Reward mobile App data.
The data set provided, entails simulated data that mimics customer behavior on Starbucks rewards mobile app.Â 
Customers using Starbucks mobile app receive random offers from Starbucks, the offer might range from merely an informational offer advertising about a drink, to an discount offer that a customer can avail on their spending's at Starbucks, or a BOGO (Buy One Get One) offer.
All these offers are time bound with a designated expiry. The customers are rewarded based on their cumulative spend activity during the period in which offer was active. The offers are sent to customers in no particular order, some customers might not receive any offer, while not all user receive the same offer.
